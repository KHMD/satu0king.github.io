            <h4>Your First Simulation</h4>
            <p>
            The first time you try using this program ,it could be confusing , but once u get started its smooth sailing. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Follow the following steps :<br>
            1) Create a light beam<br>
            2) Move it by dragging the beam source <br>
            3) Rotate it by clicking the mouse on the ends of the beam source <br>
            4) Add a couple of plane mirrors <br>
            5) Rotate and move the plane mirrors light the light beam <br>
            6) Experiment !! <br>

            <h4>Tips and Warnings</h4>
            <p>
            1) Avoid trapping light in mirrors as it may cause system to crash <br>
            2) Increased Iterations can cause system to crash<br>
            3) Lowering opacity helps visibilty of ray over lap<br>
            4) Use shades to isolate regions<br>
            5) Run Program in full screen for better experience<br>
